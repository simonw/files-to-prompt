Concatenate a directory full of files into a single prompt for use with LLMs

For background on this project see [Building files-to-prompt entirely using Claude 3 Opus](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/).

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:
```bash
pip install files-to-prompt
```

## Usage

To use `files-to-prompt`, provide the path to one or more files or directories you want to process:

```bash
files-to-prompt path/to/file_or_directory [path/to/another/file_or_directory ...]
```

This will output the contents of every file, with each file preceded by its relative path and separated by `---`.

### Options

- `--include-hidden`: Include files and folders starting with `.` (hidden files and directories).
  ```bash
  files-to-prompt path/to/directory --include-hidden
  ```

- `--ignore-gitignore`: Ignore `.gitignore` files and include all files.
  ```bash
  files-to-prompt path/to/directory --ignore-gitignore
  ```

- `--ignore <pattern>`: Specify one or more patterns to ignore. Can be used multiple times.
  ```bash
  files-to-prompt path/to/directory --ignore "*.log" --ignore "temp*"
  ```

### Example

Suppose you have a directory structure like this:

```
my_directory/
├── file1.txt
├── file2.txt
├── .hidden_file.txt
├── temp.log
└── subdirectory/
    └── file3.txt
```

Running `files-to-prompt my_directory` will output:

```
my_directory/file1.txt
---
Contents of file1.txt
---
my_directory/file2.txt
---
Contents of file2.txt
---
my_directory/temp.log
---
Contents of temp.log
---
my_directory/subdirectory/file3.txt
---
Contents of file3.txt
---
```

If you run `files-to-prompt my_directory --include-hidden`, the output will also include `.hidden_file.txt`:

```
my_directory/.hidden_file.txt
---
Contents of .hidden_file.txt
---
...
```

If you run `files-to-prompt my_directory --ignore "*.log"`, the output will exclude `temp.log`:

```
my_directory/file1.txt
---
Contents of file1.txt
---
my_directory/file2.txt
---
Contents of file2.txt
---
my_directory/subdirectory/file3.txt
---
Contents of file3.txt
---
```

## Development
